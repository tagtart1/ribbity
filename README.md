<p align='center'>A twitter inspired clone built using React</p>

## Short Description

Introducing Ribbity, a full stack Twitter-inspired project built with TypeScript, React, Firebase, and Vanilla CSS. Designed to be fully responsive on all devices, Ribbity offers a slgith alternate design with various unique features. Users can create accounts, customize profiles, and engage with others by creating, liking, sharing, and replying to Ribbits (tweets). Obtain a free green checkmark through the Ribbity Green tab as well. [Additional features below](https://github.com/tagtart1/ribbity/#features-)

## üî¥ Demo

[Live Demo](https://tweety-3dd86.web.app/) available. Click 'Live Demo' to view it. IF you wanna get quick full access to the app to demo, click 'Sign up' and create a quick account with random creditials or sign inwith Google

## Showcase üåü

Below is a collection of images and GIFs of user interaction on the site. Users initially begin on just the Explore panel where they are prompted to create an account. After doing so they can now interact with other users, customize their profile, or post their own ribbits. There are minor descriptions below each image to detail what they show.

## What I Learned üìñ

- Organizing and managing a larger codebase for efficiency and scalability
- Developing a full stack app with Firebase to store complex data and to display that data correctly
- Being able to replicate a complex design such as Twitter and to experiment on it

## Motive

I wanted to build this project to showcase my abilities of React and Typescript by creating a full stack project. While I am not 'developing' the back end, I wanted to show that I have the ability to connect the front-end and back-end technologies together to create a functional app. Futhermore, I wanted to show I can create, manage and understand large codebases like this on my own. In the future, I strive to learn how to develop my own backend and collaborate with others on project while also using SCSS/SASS. Upon completing this project I can now visualize how large professional websites and applications were developed behind the scenes which gives me confidence to continue developing professional websites
